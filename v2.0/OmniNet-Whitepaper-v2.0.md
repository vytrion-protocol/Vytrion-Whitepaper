ABSTRACT

OmniNet is a next-generation internet architecture designed to unify identity, data, intelligence, and interaction into a single, secure, user-owned network layer.

It replaces the platform-controlled Web2 model and the unstable token-driven Web3 model with a system built around:

• OmniID — Universal cryptographic identity
• OmniVault — Local-first personal encrypted data vault
• OmniGraph — Semantic knowledge graph
• OmniUI — Holographic, AI-native interface
• OmniSync — Distributed state synchronization
• OmniMesh — Peer-based device network
• OmniProtocol — New communication layer
• OmniChain — Global state integrity
• HyperStructures — Distributed compute layer
• PrimeNet — Global routing fabric
• OmniEconomy — Trust-based value model
• OmniNet SDK — Graph-native development platform

OmniNet becomes the foundation for the next era of computing:
identity-driven, AI-native, holographic, distributed, and user-owned.

SECTION 1 — OmniNet Overview and Vision

OmniNet aims to become the unified digital layer of the modern world — where identity, data, intelligence, interaction, and global connectivity merge into a single, human-centric system.

Today’s digital world is built on:

• siloed identities
• centralized platforms
• invasive data models
• incompatible devices
• cloud dependency
• poor privacy
• no global intelligence layer

OmniNet replaces this with:

• self-sovereign identity (OmniID)
• encrypted personal data (OmniVault)
• a unified knowledge model (OmniGraph)
• holographic, spatial interfaces (OmniUI)
• distributed personal computing (OmniMesh)
• global privacy-first routing (PrimeNet)
• verifiable state integrity (OmniChain)
• distributed compute (HyperStructures)
• graph-native development (OmniNet SDK)

OmniNet is not a website.
Not an app.
Not a blockchain.
Not a cloud service.

It is the new internet layer.

SECTION 2 — The Internet Is Broken

The current internet has seven critical failures.

Identity Fragmentation
Every platform creates a new version of you.

Surveillance Data Economy
Companies own your data — not you.

Centralized Control
Cloud platforms control accounts, access, devices, and communications.

No AI Safety Grounding
AI does not understand your identity, preferences, or context.

Device Isolation
Your devices do not share memory, state, or tasks.

Privacy Collapse
Mass data extraction is the default.

Outdated Interfaces
Apps, windows, and tabs do not match the needs of AR, AI, or multi-agent workflows.

OmniNet solves all seven.

SECTION 3 — OmniNet Architecture Summary

OmniNet consists of a 12-layer integrated architecture:

Identity Layer — OmniID
Data Layer — OmniVault
Knowledge Layer — OmniGraph
Sync Layer — OmniSync
Device Layer — OmniMesh
Network Layer — PrimeNet
Integrity Layer — OmniChain
Compute Layer — HyperStructures
Intelligence Layer — Intent Graph
Interface Layer — OmniUI
OS Layer — OmniNet OS
Developer Layer — OmniNet SDK

These layers form a unified digital substrate that replaces cloud accounts, apps, servers, identity providers, and blockchain systems.

SECTION 4 — Phase 1: OmniID

OmniID is the foundation of trust for OmniNet.

It provides:

• universal cryptographic identity
• device subkeys
• signature system
• encrypted channels
• permission control
• revocation
• trust scoring

OmniID replaces passwords, accounts, OAuth, and blockchain wallets with a portable, self-owned identity.

SECTION 5 — Phase 2: OmniVault

OmniVault is the encrypted personal data layer that stores:

• files
• AI embeddings
• private graph nodes
• preferences
• agent memory
• device data

It is encrypted, local-first, user-owned, permission-scoped, and sync-enabled.

SECTION 6 — Phase 3: OmniGraph

OmniGraph is the semantic memory of OmniNet — your personal knowledge graph.

It stores:

• memories
• tasks
• relationships
• digital objects
• context
• system state

Everything is represented as nodes, edges, and metadata.

OmniGraph becomes the digital brain of the user.

SECTION 7 — Phase 4: OmniUI

OmniUI is the interface layer for:

• screens
• AR devices
• holographic workspaces
• multimodal environments

It includes:

• spatial panels
• holographic surfaces
• anchors
• intent-driven UI

OmniUI replaces app windows, tabs, and websites with a spatial, intelligent interface layer.
